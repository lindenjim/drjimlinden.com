		<p>Jim Linden was born and raised in Michigan.  He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Michigan in 1964, and his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from Michigan State University in 1968.  Dr. Linden was a Professor of Psychology at California State University, Long Beach, from 1968 until he retired from teaching in 2003.  During his tenure at CSULB he founded and was first Director of the Community Psychology Clinic in 1970, and served on its faculty for over 25 years. He also was a co-founder of the Masters of Arts Program in Community/Clinical Psychology at CSULB.  Dr. Linden has been in independent private practice as a psychologist since 1971.</p>

		<p>Jim was raised in a family in which the ethic of “giving back to the community” was taught.  In addition to his work as a professor and psychologist, he has been actively engaged in community service for the 50 years he has lived in southern California.  He has received numerous awards during this time for his leadership in many civic arenas, including spearheading the establishment of a senior HUD housing project in Long Beach, serving as a founding Board Member of the Heritage Pointe Home for the Aging in Orange County, serving as President of Temple Israel of Long Beach, and consulting with Head Start and the Community Improvement League in Long Beach.  Among the honors he has received are the Hannah G. Solomon Service Award from the National Council of Jewish Women, and the Distinguished Service Award from the National Conference of Equality and Justice (formerly the National Council of Christians and Jews). </p>

		<p>Dr. Linden says, “I have been fortunate to have developed a successful and busy private practice over the years.  When you live in a community for a long time, you develop relationships with many people, both in your field and outside.  I have come to know and respect many physicians and other mental health personnel in the area and, I believe, have earned their respect, as well.</p>

		<p>“I have always believed that success in life results from hard work and an attitude of respect for other people. I try to “practice what I preach” in my work as a psychologist.  I treat each patient with care and genuine concern, and I attempt to communicate this in a context of a feeling of warmth and attention to each client’s individual needs.  Along with my secretary/office manager, Toria, we try to make each client feel as special as they deserve to feel.  I look forward to working with you if you choose to trust me with your personal life concerns, and I will do my best to help you not only get through your time of need, but also to use this as an opportunity to enhance your emotional growth and personal fulfillment.”</p>

		<p>Dr. Linden has been married since 1978 and, with his wife, Nancy, has two grown sons and three grandchildren. He resides in Long Beach.</p>
